# WeatherProject
This is my first IoT project . Main focus was to create a system to monitor the weather component like humidity , temperature and more . By getting real time information about the local weather provides us with the choice to be ready for any sudden changes .
Objective - 
To monitor the instant temperature and humidity.
To get real time update in both website and mobile app. 
System Overview -
Hardware - ESP8266 Microcontroller , DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor , Breadboard and necessary wirings . 
Software - Arduino IDE and necessary libraries , Blynk . 
Cloud Integration - Blynk IoT was used as the web and mobile app interface . It gave the real time update of humidity and temperature. 
Features - 
Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring . 
Mobile app interface for remote notifications using Blynk IoT . 
Application - 
Local weather update . 
Necessary precaution forecast for adverse weather.
Future Upgrade - 
using AI models to predict weather forecast and analyze local season . This could help to take decision regarding farming , travel and a lot more instances.
